# CSCI 4237 - Project 1 - Day Trip Planner
Day Trip Planner is a simple app to help plan interesting things to do near a desired location.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Create a new Android Studio project. During the initial project setup, set the `Save location` to the folder that was created when you cloned this repo (e.g. so you can commit your project back into this repo).
3. Use git to add, commit, and push your new project to the `master` branch - now you have your start pointing set locally and on GitHub! You are now ready to get started.
4. Don't forget to branch before you create commits - you'll need to create Pull Requests for the major project deliverables.
